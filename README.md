The approach to this portfolio was to create a simple, yet clean UI for user accessibility. Router was used to link all pages together, and keyframes were added to create a seamless transition between them. Additionally, Filesaver was used to create a downloadable link for my resume. Axios was used to fetch my repo data through the Github API.

If I had to do this project over, I would spend some time creating a filter project feature, and create additonal pages for each featured project, to allow for a more indepth view of my thought process behind each one. I think I would also update the styling to make the website pop more.
